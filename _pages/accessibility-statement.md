# Accessibility Statement

**Our Goal:**  
Fuel Web Marketing is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We continue to make changes to improve the user experience for everyone and apply the relevant accessibility standards.

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

Fuel Web Marketing tries diligently to adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AAA guidelines, which states that sites should be:

- Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable
- Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies
