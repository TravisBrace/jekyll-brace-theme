Cases We Handle
---------------

Our law firm assists people injured in a wide range of accidents. To discuss your specific accident and whether we can help, contact us directly.

### Car Accidents

[Car accidents](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/personal-injury-law/auto-accidents/) can happen around Sarasota for many reasons, and when you least expect them - even if you are a safe and careful driver, you cannot control how other drivers behave on the road. Some common causes of car accidents include:

-   [Distracted driving](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving)

-   Drowsy driving

-   [Driving under the influence](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0316/Sections/0316.193.html)

-   Aggressive driving

-   Speeding

-   Running red lights

-   Violating other traffic laws

-   Defective vehicles

-   Dangerous road conditions

Car accident claims are different in Florida than in many other states, as Florida still has no-fault insurance. You first need to seek compensation from your [personal injury protection (PIP)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.736.html) policy, and only those with serious injuries might file claims against the liable parties.

Just because you are filing a claim against your own insurance company does not mean it will be an easy process, however. Your insurer can still put up a fight and try to avoid paying you the full amount that you deserve for your claim. It is important to have a personal injury lawyer helping with your car crash claim.

### Bicycle Accidents and Pedestrian Accidents

In many situations, cyclists or pedestrians are hit by negligent drivers who might be distracted, intoxicated, or otherwise in [violation of the law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0316/0316.html). Drivers should always safely share the road with bicycles and people walking in designated areas, and they should always be prepared to yield when necessary to crosswalks, bike lanes, and more.

Unfortunately, drivers are often not paying attention or might be in a hurry, so they fail to notice walk signals or bikes on the road. This is particularly dangerous since neither pedestrians nor cyclists have many protections from the impact of a vehicle or the ground.

Because they are so exposed, these accident victims can suffer severe and life-changing injuries. These can include:

-   [Traumatic brain injury](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/personal-injury-law/traumatic-brain-injury/)

-   [Spinal cord injury](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/personal-injury-law/spinal-cord-injury/)

-   Neck and back injuries

-   Crush injuries

-   Fractures

-   Soft tissue injuries

-   Internal injuries

Even a cyclist's helmet does not always protect from head trauma, and many people hit while riding or walking need extensive medical treatment and recovery time. Some are left with permanent effects and impairments from their injuries.

Drivers who are negligent and [injure pedestrians](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/personal-injury-law/pedestrian-accidents/) or [cyclists](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/personal-injury-law/bicycle-accidents/) in the Sarasota area should be held fully liable for the injuries and losses suffered. You need the right legal help following serious injuries.

### Commercial Truck Accidents

Truck accidents are often more complicated than other types of injury-causing accidents. This is because [commercial vehicles](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/personal-injury-law/commercial-truck-crashes/) are highly complex machines, and many things can lead to a crash. In addition, claims are often not only against individual drivers but also trucking companies and other corporations.

Trucking companies can be vicariously liable for the harm caused by truck drivers, which might include:

-   [Violating federal trucking regulations](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations)

-   Alcohol or drug use behind the wheel

-   Improper inspection of the truck

-   Driving too long and becoming overly fatigued

-   Aggressive driving behaviors

-   Driving too fast for road conditions

Trucking companies can also be negligent in their own right, including hiring or retaining dangerous drivers, failing to supervise drivers, failing to maintain trucks in the fleet, and more.

Filing insurance claims against corporate trucking policies can be an uphill battle. These insurers know the truck industry is high-risk, and they have tools to avoid liability whenever they can. You need to have strong evidence to prove your truck accident claim.

Proving liability in a truck crash can be a difficult task since investigations can be highly technical. You want a law firm on your side with the resources needed to conduct a thorough investigation and gather the necessary evidence of liability, and you should call [Matthews Injury Law](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/) right away.

Can I Afford a Personal Injury Lawyer in Sarasota?
--------------------------------------------------

Many injury victims are hesitant to contact a lawyer since they do not think they can afford to pay the required legal fees. While many types of lawyers do require large upfront retainers, personal injury law firms work differently.

Our Sarasota personal [injury attorneys](https://matthewspersonalinjurylaw.com/legal-team/marc-matthews/) work on a contingency fee basis. This means that if we are unsuccessful at recovering damages for you, we never receive any fees. If you receive a settlement or award for your losses, our fees come directly from that payment. No money ever has to come from your bank account, so you do not need to worry if you do not have funds for legal fees from the start.

Before you hire us, we go over how we charge in careful detail, so you know exactly what you are agreeing to, and there are no surprises.
